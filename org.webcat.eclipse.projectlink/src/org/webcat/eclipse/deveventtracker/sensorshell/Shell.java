/**
 * An interface that is implemented by SensorShell and MultiSensorShell. This enables
 * sensors that can restrict themselves to the use of the following public methods to
 * easily toggle between the use of SensorShell or MultiSensorShell depending upon 
 * load requirements.
 * 
 * As a simple example, a sensor might contain code similar to the following:
 * <pre>
 * boolean useMulti = isMultiSensorShellRequested();
 * Shell shell = (useMulti) ? new MultiSensorShell(...) : new SensorShell(...);
 *  :
 * shell.add(...)
 *  :
 * shell.quit()
 * </pre>
 * Thus, the decision to use a SensorShell vs. a MultiSensorShell can be made at run-time.

   * with a timer-based process in the sensor client.  The timer-based process should wake up 
   * at regular intervals, determine the currently "active" resource (typically a file), and 
   * compute a "checksum" for that resource representing its state. (This checksum is typically
   * the size of the resource in bytes or characters.) Having obtained those two values, the 
   * sensor client can then create a keyValMap as if it were going to do a regular Add command,
   * and invoke this method with it as well as with the resourceCheckSum.  This method keeps
   * track of the last Resource and last ResourceCheckSum provided to it, and if either has
   * changed, it will automatically invoke the Add command, passing the keyValMap to it. 
   * <p>
   * Thus, if an editor is running but the user is out at lunch, repeated invocations of the 
   * StateChange method will not result in any new data being sent to the server.
