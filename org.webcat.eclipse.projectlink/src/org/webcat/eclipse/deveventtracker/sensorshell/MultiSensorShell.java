/**
 * MultiSensorShell is a wrapper around SingleSensorShell that is designed for high performance
 * transmission of sensor data instances from a client to a server. Prior research has determined
 * that when a single SensorShell is used to transmit a large amount of data in a short period of
 * time, it can spend a substantial portion of its time blocked while waiting for an HTTP PUT to
 * complete. MultiSensorShell overcomes this problem by instantiating multiple SensorShell instances
 * internally and then passing sensor data to them in a round-robin fashion. Each SensorShell is
 * passed an autoSendTimeInterval value, which results in a separate thread for each SensorShell
 * instance that will concurrently send any buffered data at regular time intervals. This
 * significantly reduces blocked time for MultiSensorShell, because when any individual SensorShell
 * instance is performing its HTTP PUT call, the MultiSensorShell can be concurrently adding data to
 * one of the other SensorShell instances.
 * <p>
 * The sensorshell.properties file provides a number of tuning parameters for MultiSensorShell
 * processing. We currently recommend the following settings for best performance:
 * <ul>
 * <li>sensorshell.multishell.enabled = true
 * <li>sensorshell.multishell.numshells = 10
 * <li>sensorshell.multishell.batchsize = 250
 * <li>sensorshell.multishell.autosend.timeinterval = 0.05
 * <li>sensorshell.autosend.maxbuffer = 1000
 * <li>sensorshell.timeout = 30
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that offline storage and recovery are automatically disabled when multishell is enabled.
 * <p>
 * The TestMultiSensorShell class provides a main() method that we have used to do some simple
 * performance evaluation, which we report on next. All results were obtained using a MacBook Pro
 * with a 2.33 Ghz Intel Core Duo processor and 3 GB of 667 Mhz DDR2 SDRAM. Both the client and
 * SensorBase server were running on this computer to minimize network latency issues.
 * <p>
 * If you instantiate a MultiSensorShell with the number of SensorShells set to 1, you effectively
 * get the default case. In this situation, we have found that the average time to send a single
 * SensorData instance is approximately 6 milliseconds, almost independent of the settings for
 * batchSize and the autoSendInterval. Increasing the number of SensorShell instances to 5 doubles
 * the throughput, to approximately 3 milliseconds per instance. At this point, some kind of
 * performance plateau is reached, with further tweaking of the tuning parameters seeming to have
 * little effect. We do not know whether this is a "real" limit or an artificial limit based upon
 * some environmental feature.
 * <p>
 * With the sensorshell.properties settings listed above, we have 
 * achieved throughput of 2.8 milliseconds per instance (which is equivalent to 360 instances per
 * second and 1.2M instances per hour.)
 * <p>
 * We have also found that we can store around 350,000 sensor data instances per GB of disk space.
 * <p>
 * Note that we are effectively disabling autosend.batchsize by setting it
 * to a high value (30,000). This is because 
 * reaching the batchSize limit forces a blocking send() of the data, which is precisely what we
 * want to avoid in MultiSensorShell.  Instead, we try to tune the autosend.timeinterval so that as
 * many of our send() invocations as possible occur asynchronously in a separate thread. 
 * <p>
 * Note that a single SensorShell instance is simpler, creates less processing overhead, and has
 * equivalent performance to MultiSensorShell for transmission loads up to a dozen or so sensor data
 * instances per second. We recommend using a single SensorShell instance rather than
 * MultiSensorShell unless optimizing data transmission throughput is an important requirement.
